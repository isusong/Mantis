In folder `app', `base', `io' are the source files. 

The main function is in program file ./app/main.cpp. 

Note that:

1) does not support flip any more (of course, we can 
   add this functionality later if needed).

2) In the main function, we can get seed by time.

3) Some functions are changed so that the lengths of 
   the two traces to be compared can be different

4) Instead of randomly select traces to compare, 
   we do pairwise comparison for all files in a specified folder.
   Each file stores a trace.

5) Since this is the code modified based on previous code,
   some comments are added by mavierck are indicated for the 
   sake of knowing which is which. 
   The original comments are kept thought it might not be correct
   sometimes.
