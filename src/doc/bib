* Petraco et al. Statistical Pattern Comparison of Striated Tool Marks. J Forensic Sci. 2012

Summary - Petraco's group gives a full literary search of the existing studies on tool mark and bullet comparisons.  They also describe in detail the recent criticisms concerning tool mark analysis and the admissibility of examiner testimony in court proceedings.  The basics of impression evidence analysis and commericial systems are described. Finally, Petraco et al describes their research into using machine learning methods to match the tool marks.

Relevance - An excellent introduction to the field of impression evidence analysis. Thorough in making arguments for the study of tool mark analysis, but not necessarily thorough in describing previous studies. Provides a roadmap for the original papers on the subject.

* Chumbley et al. Validation of Tool Mark Comparisons Obtained Using a Quantitative, Comparative, Statistical Algorithm. J Forensic Sci. 2010

Summary - This describes the statistical algorithm developed at ISU for comparing single traces of screwdriver marks in lead.  50 sequentially numbered screwdriver tips were used to generate marks at 30, 60, and 85 degrees.  Marks were scanned via profilometer. T1 statistics were calculated for each set of marks, and 20 pairs that were difficult for the algorithm were also compared at the 2008 AFTE training meeting in Honolulu by experienced examiners.  The AFTE meeting revealed the need for contextual clues in the marks to be taken into account by the algorithm.  The examiners on the whole performed better than the algorithm.

Relevance - Mantis Tool Mark Simulator currently uses this statistical algorithm (as a "library") for comparisons between the virtual mark and the evidence mark.  This paper also provides background on the history of impression analysis in foresics, as well as the basis for the beginning of the Tool Mark Simulator.  In other words, it is useful as an illustration of where the research has been.
